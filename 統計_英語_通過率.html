They may not look great, but they taste just as good as the pretty ones.  These strange-looking fruit and vegetables are called “seconds.”  About 20-40% of what farmers grow is not so beautiful.  Sadly, these “seconds” seldom arrive at your table, but often go straight into the trash can.  Why?  It’s because supermarkets don’t want to buy them from farmers—they believe their shoppers only love beautiful things.  Because of these “seconds,” some farmers lose a lot of money.  Wonky Markt wishes to change this.  We’re helping sell these “seconds.”  Farmers can save them from the trash can, and you can get them at a lower price.</td>

I’ll do it in a “bain-marie,” or, well, some people call it “water bath.”  I myself love the name “bain-marie.”  To make a “bain-marie,” you need two pots, one bigger than the other.  First, break the chocolate into small pieces and put them in the smaller pot.  Usually when making chocolate desserts, you’ll need tomix chocolate with butter and sugar.  So if you do, put them in thepot too. Now, half fill the bigger pot with warm water.  Put the smaller pot over the bigger one, and start to slowly mix the chocolate, the butter, andthe sugar together.  Keep the water under 50ºC, or the chocolate may lose itsshine.  And make sure that no water goes in the smaller pot, or the chocolate willbecome hard and cannot be used. Keep mixing for about five to ten minutes, and the job is done.  Easy, right? mix 混合</td>

The superb fairy-wren, one kind of bright-blue bird in Australia, is one example.  This year, a ten-year study showed that this small bird has eggs of different sizes in different kinds of weather.  When the weather is hot and dry, there is less food for young superb fairy-wrens, and they die easily.  So the mother bird will make larger eggs to help her babies grow stronger inside before they break out of the eggs into the “hungry” world. However, not all mother birds are able to do this trick.  Only those with at least one male child can.  When the weather is “good,” the mother will make smaller eggs, and her sons will bring food back for their baby brothers and sisters from the eggs.  With her sons’ help, the mother can save more energy to make larger eggs when the weather is bad.  Isn’t this amazing?  male 雄性   energy 能量</td>

I have a lot of things I don’t need, so I’mthinking about having a yard sale.  What do you think?Having a yard sale is not easy.  You have to collect things, put prices on them, put them out on tables and then wait for people to come.  And usually you have to sell things at VERY low prices.  For all that time and work, you make very little money.  Why not just sell your things online for higher prices?Debby’s right.  But I think it’d be even better to just give your things to people who need them.  I just sent out a lot of things last week.Hey, I love yard sales!  It’s a great chance to make big money if you pick the right day.  In my experience, Saturday is the best.I agree with Albert.  You can make money and meet interesting people.  I made some good friends at my last yard sale.</td>

The owners of the food truck are Thomas and Diana Yang, two Taiwanese-Americans.  This brother-sister team started their business in 2009.  Back then, there were a few Taiwanese restaurants in the city and several thousand food trucks, but the Yangs were the first to sell Taiwanese food on a food truck.At first, business was slack.  People thought they were just another Chinese food truck, and the food truck’s name, “Cravings,” often made people think of desserts, not lunch.  Few people would stop by and try their food.  “I couldn’t even give away free food,” said Thomas.  To catch people’s eye, they painted their truck blue, and drew Taiwan’s national flower, the plum blossom, on it.  They also changed the food truck’s name to “bian-dang.”  Soon people started to notice them, and business finally got better.  Now on a good day, they can sell about 150 bian-dangs in about two hours.So what’s next for Thomas and Diana?  Well, they hope one day there will be a block with Taiwanese food in the city, just like there is a Chinatown, a Korea Town, and a Little Italy.  And their bian-dang food truck might just help to make that happen. national 國家的</td>

Expensive hotels that may make you feel like you don’t get what you pay for?  Or cheap hostels that put you and five other strangers in the same bedroom?  If both choices sound terrible to you, here’s something new: holiday apartments.In a holiday apartment, you have more space than what a hotel room can give you.  Everything in the apartment is at your disposal.  The living room, the kitchen, the study, and, of course, the bedrooms are all for your own use.  Some apartments even have a lovely garden or a game room.  You’ll feel at home in the holiday apartment.  The best thing is, a holiday apartment is not expensive.  The price for a holiday apartment is for two people, and the apartment is often cheaper than a hotel room for two.  You only need to pay a little more for a third or fourth person.  If you travel with friends or your family, a holiday apartment will be your best choice! hostel (提供廉價食宿的)旅舍</td>

In Zurich, people are welcome, but cars are not!  Over the past 20 years, this city has used smart ways     19    .  One is to keep the same total number of parking spaces.  For example, if 50 new parking spaces are built in one part of the city, then 50 old spaces in other parts are taken away for other uses.  So the total number does not change.  Some are unhappy that there are never enough spaces.  That is just what the city has in mind: If people find parking more difficult, they will drive less.      20    , the total number of cars in the city is counted.  Over 3,500 little computers are put under Zurich roads to check the number of cars that enter the city.  If the number is higher than the city can deal with, the traffic lights on the roads that enter the city will be kept red.  So drivers who are traveling into Zurich have to stop and wait until there are fewer cars in the city.  Now, you may wonder     21    .  The answer is simple: The city wants to make more space for its people.</td>

Now another has been found.  Its name is HD189773b.  HD189773b is an      16   exoplanet, a planet outside our Solar System, and is one of the nearest exoplanets to Earth.  Even so, .  Here’s why: It is 63 light years away.  That means it is 370,440,000,000,000 miles from us.  Even if we fly at 3,500     17     miles an hour, it will take more than 12 million years to get there.: It is much bigger, it is made of gas and it is burning hot.  In heat as great as 1,000°C, life is not possible.  What is worse, it rains glass.  If      18   1,000°C does not kill you, glass rain will.Even so, finding this blue giant .  It is the first time that we have been able to see the color of an exoplanet.  The color of a planet gives us ideas about what is happening on it.  While we have a long way to go before we find a new planet to live on, finding a blue dot is a good start.   系外行星   Solar System 太陽系exoplanet</td>

When a dog gets wet, all it needs is to shake its body.  A study in 2010 showed that a wet dog can throw off half the water on its body by shaking for less than a second.  In fact, this common act of dogs works better than a washing machine.  The study found that animal shaking begins with the head and ends with the tail.  During a shake, the animal’s head, body and skin all move.  Smaller animals must shake faster than bigger animals to get water off.  For example, in one second, a rat can shake 18 times, a dog 6 times, and a bear 4 times.  Bigger animals can get their bodies dry with fewer shakes.For animals, shaking is not just about getting themselves dry.  It is also about saving their lives.  Being wet makes animals heavier, and that makes it harder to run.  In the animal world, how fast an animal can run often decides whether it will live or not.  Maybe that’s why the “wet-dog shake” has become a common habit of many animals. skin 皮膚</td>

Well, this happens to most of us and is not helpful for our learning!Some studies show that teenagers’ brains make melatonin, the hormone that helps sleep, between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m.  So it’s better for us to sleep during these nine hours.  But here comes the problem.  We’re asked to get to school by 7:30 a.m.  That means we have to get up before 7, when our brains should still be sleeping.  That’s why we’re always so tired and can’t think clearly in early morning classes. N  o clear head, no good learning, right?If we can’t change how our body works, why can’t school start later?  In this way, we can not only sleep more but also learn better!Want to help us make it happen?  Visit www.nvhsstudsup.org/later-better to learn more. brain 大腦  hormone 荷爾蒙</td>

So it would be better if we move Weekend’s Best Buy from Saturday evening to Saturday afternoon when there may be more shoppers during the sale.  We should also think about having more free buses during the weekend, as 75% of the shoppers who were interviewed said two buses an hour are just not enough.  Weekend evenings are second busiest, though it is not as good as last season.  An interesting fact is that business is better on weekday evenings, usually one hour before closing, than on weekend mornings.  Most of the shoppers then are people who live near or working parents who do their last-minute shopping.  They together make up almost 60% of the business on weekday evenings.  It might bring in more business if we open half an hour longer during weekdays, until 10:30 p.m. as 由於   make up 構成；組成</td>

But there is one important thing you may never have thought about: Has your doctor rested enough?Doctors in our country often have to work 34 hours or longer without sleep.  Most of them work 104 hours a week, and some even 150. (There are only 168 hours a week!)  One report said that a doctor who works such long hours cannot think more clearly than a drunk driver.  Another found that doctors who sleep 5.8 fewer hours than the week before might make 22% more serious mistakes.  Surely no one wants to get in a car that is driven by a drunk driver.  So, how safe would you feel when you are under the care of a tired doctor?Sadly this problem has been around for a long time.  There are no laws about it yet and hospital bosses don’t look like they care either.  And that is why we doctors are asking you to join us on the street this Sunday.  Fight together with us on the street so we can fight better for your life in the hospital. Time: 1 p.m. May 2nd     Place: City Hospital Square drunk 酒醉的   law 法律</td>

He would be in a race with Roald Amundsen, from Norway.  Both left their countries by ship in June of 1910 and arrived in Antarctica in January of 1911.About ten months later, both teams started their trips down to the South Pole.      40    .  Amundsen’s team used dogs, and Scott’s team used horses.  Because horses weren’t good at traveling on snow, it took Scott’s team 77 days to arrive at the South Pole.  They got there on January 17, 1912, and were surprised to find that Amundsen was ahead of them.  The news hit Scott very hard, but what he didn’t know was that     41    .  His team began their long trip home with broken hearts.  After days of terrible weather and little food, Scott lost his men one after another, and he himself was the last one to meet the end of his life.

In Taiwan, it is known as zhizha and is usually burned as a gift for dead people.  Taiwan’s papier-mâché is dying because it is not much needed now.  However, this dying art won a Frenchman’s heart when he visited the island.  He then invited one of the papier-mâché shops, Hsin Hsin Paper Offering Store, to show their beautiful works in France.  The shop owner’s son also used papier-mâché in a way that no one ever thought of—making a movie with it.Stan Lai is very important in Taiwan’s theater.  He brought changes to Chinese theater art of the old days to make it closer to our life experiences and easier to understand.  One of his most famous works is That Evening, We Performed Crosstalk (1985).  It was such a smash hit that people became interested again in xiangsheng, a show of funny talk between two actors.  This art used to be a hobby that only a few people shared, but Lai has opened a bigger market for it.  Now it has fans across all ages. work 作品</td>

While my parents were preparing dinner, my brother and I were playing by the lake.  A dirty man appeared from somewhere, and his face was half covered by his hair.  He walked to us and asked for some water.When I gave him water, the bag he carried dropped, and things inside fell out on the grass.  I saw a rope, a knife, and a baseball bat.  The strangest thing was that there were also a woman’s shoe and a ring, and I’m sure they were not his.  The man quickly put all his things back in the bag and looked at us angrily.  At that moment, the picture of a man the police was looking for came to my mind.  He was the crazy killer!  I was so afraid that I could not move at all.Luckily, before he could get any closer, my mom shouted from far away, and the man hurried off into the dark. while 當……之時</td>

To the cities that fight for this chance,   38  .  The Olympics usually do a lot of good to the host city.  The Games bring in jobs, visitors, and, most important of all, money.  So why did people in Munich say no?The Olympics   39   for people in Munich.  For them, the world’s biggest sports festival could invite serious trouble.  There would be a lot of building work before the Games, and during the Games, too much traffic and too many visitors.  Life would become terrible and nature would be hurt.  And   40  : Munich hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics, and its neighbor, the mountain town Garmisch-Partenkirchen, hosted the 1936 Winter Olympics.  Still, the heavy price Munich paid does not worry the cities that are in the race to get the 2022 Winter Olympics.     41  , they are happy that Munich said no to the Olympics—their chances of getting the Games have become higher. host 舉辦  Olympics 奧運  visitor 遊客</td>

From 1946 to 1986, about 340,000 whales were killed.  People worry that children in the future can only see whales in pictures.  They believe all kinds of whaling (whale hunting) should be stopped before it’s too late.Some people are trying to stop whaling all over the world.  But they fail to notice one fact: Whaling was going on for a long time before the number of whales went down and became a problem.Whaling started as early as 1,500 years ago.  This was how tribespeople fed their families.  They hunted whales for meat because almost nothing could grow on their land.  They also made whale fat into oil and used it to make candles or oil lamps.  Over the years, whaling became their way of living, and even part of who they are.Tribe whaling is not the thing we should worry about.  Of all the whales that were killed over the past forty years, only 10% were hunted by tribespeople.  The other 90% died at the hands of the money-making whaling business.  When we try to stop all kinds of whaling, we should think what we are asking tribespeople to give up and whether this is the best answer to the problem of whaling. tribe 部落   fat 脂肪</td>

To start with, the number of church-goers is dropping sharply (see Figure 1).  Many say they do not belong to any church, and those who do go less often than they used to.  Going to church appears less and less on people’s to-do list.  Another worrying fact is that fewer and fewer young people go to church, which leads to an older church (see Figure 2).And there is also the problem with money.  Keeping a church door open is not cheap.  Fewer people going to church means little money coming in.  This makes it harder to keep a church open.  When the time comes for a church to close, there is little to do but to sell it.  Churches that were lucky enough to find a buyer were put to other uses.  Some were changed into restaurants or school gyms, and some even became nightclubs, for example.  Churches that had little luck were knocked down in the end.  Just like a store that keeps losing business needs to think of ways to save itself, it is perhaps time for the church to try to win people’s hearts back and play an important part in people’s lives again.  This is not something that one can simply pray to get an answer to.

He often said that he got my mother to marry him with a table of delicious food, not with a beautiful ring.  “A family needs only one good cook,” he said.Now I am a cook myself.

Last week Carolyn Cole won the Inscriber Prize, the country’s biggest book prize, with her book Paper Soldier.  Cole herself did not show up for the prize.  It was not only the first time in history that a first-time writer won the prize, but also the first time that the winner did not appear.  Now here comes another “first time” for the Inscriber: Cole is not real.  “She” is in fact Thomas Goode.  Goode is known for his picture books.  His best-known book, Blue Moon, won him two national book prizes and sold over one million copies.  Goode had tried to write “serious” books before.  His first try was Parent, which came out in 2006.  Sadly, Goode’s big name did not help, and there was little interest in Parent.  Goode’s friend told NBN that he wanted to write a book under a different name.  Goode thought that people might treat his book seriously if they did not know it was from a picture book writer.  For the moment, there has been no word from Goode yet.</td>

When the sales did not grow with the heat, Jerry started to worry.  He wanted to send Dan home.  But how could he?  Dan had no family except him.Then, one day,     36    .

It cannot be found on most maps of Alaska because it is only 10 km2.  This small Arctic village is home to 400 Inuit people*.  However, their home will become uninhabitable because the island could be covered by the Chukchi Sea by 2025.  These Inuit people will have to leave their home.   But life now is already difficult.  Over the past twenty years, winters have become warmer, the Arctic ice has kept melting, and the sea has been rising.  These changes have made it harder to live by hunting and fishing than before.  What’s worse, there is no Arctic ice thick enough to keep them safe from terrible wind and rain.                   These Inuit people think it is the oil and power companies in Alaska that have brought all these troubles, but they are the ones who are paying the price.  It would cost hundreds of millions to move their village, and they have no idea where to get the money.  Groups like ReLocate are working together with the Inuit people to save Kivalina, but nobody is sure if their hard work will come to anything.  All the Inuit people can do now is to pray the rising sea will not cover their home too soon.* The Inuit people are a group of people who live in the Arctic. melt 融化  hunt 打獵  company 公司</td>

請翻頁繼續作答(31-33)Cinema TimesJune 5th, 2005Thanks to globalization, we get to see movies from around the world.  If anyone should feel most excited about globalization, it is US movie makers.  A study in 2001 shows that, for every 100 people who go to the theater, 85 see US movies.  This may be good news for US movie makers, but not for those in other countries.Chart 1 shows the percentages (%) of US movies in five countries in 1984 and in 2001; Chart 2 shows the percentages (%) of domestic movies in the five countries in 1984 and in 2001.  In Chart 1, we can see that US movies have been popular in foreign markets.  In Chart 2, we can see that domestic movies in the five countries are not doing well in their domestic market.  The falling market for domestic movies may be a serious problem, but there is something more important.  When people welcome US movies with open arms, they in fact also say yes to the American way of thinking.  Some people in these countries worry that what is lost may not just be their domestic market for domestic movies, but also their own way of thinking that has been passed down from parents to children. globalization 全球化   domestic 當地的；國產的；本國的10</td>

It hurts me to think that you’re going to     36    .  I know you’ve always wanted to be like those actresses with big eyes and slim legs, but in fact you are already beautiful.  What you are born with makes you special because nobody looks the same as you.  It worries me more that     37    .  But sadly, there’s no quick fix to this, not even with the doctor’s help.  If you don’t try to like yourself first, no one else will.  People like you not because of your face, but because of your heart.  You need to understand this first.  Until you understand this, nothing is going to be different even if you have this change.  I truly hope you think this through again.Love, Linda</td>

But a report from Asap Science says otherwise.  It says the worst time for coffee is soon after we get up.  When we wake up, our bodies start to make cortisol.  Cortisol helps us to think clearly and be quick to understand and act.  The cortisol levels rise after we wake up and climb to the highest in about an hour.  So there are two problems when we drink coffee during this time: (1) our bodies will make less cortisol, and (2) the cortisol will make coffee less useful.  And that’s why some of us drink more and more coffee.Then, when’s the best time to have coffee?  When the cortisol levels are going down, the report says.  Cortisol levels are usually highest between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., between noon and 1 p.m., and between 5:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.  So if you want to have coffee, enjoy it after these times, and this popular drink will help you the most.  cortisol 皮質醇   level 數值；濃度</td>

His biggest dream was to find the best pond to swim freely without worrying about water snakes.  One day, Froggie hopped to a kitchen and jumped into a pot full of hot water.  Froggie felt the burning heat and hurried out of the water as fast as his legs could carry him.  “I almost died there!” Froggie thought.A few days later, Froggie went back to the same kitchen, totally forgetting he had been there.  He again hopped into the same pot.  This time, the water inside was cool.  He looked around and thought, “There’s no water snake trying to eat me and I can have this place all to myself!”  At that moment, Froggie knew it was his dream pond.  What he didn’t know was that the water was warming up over a low heat.After thirty minutes of swimming, Froggie felt the water was warmer but he thought of this as a nice surprise.  “This sure is the best place for swimming.  I get to have a hot bath, too.”  During his comfortable bath, the water kept getting warmer and warmer.  Froggie was so comfortable that he fell asleep.  And he never woke up.</td>

By July, almost every part of the country had been attacked by Cow Cold.  In only two months, the number of dead cows has risen to 5,000.  Though Cow Cold started in the south, the east of the country is the worst hit area.  By this week, 80% of the farms in Osten State have reported cases of Cow Cold.The sale of milk in Osten State has slumped because of Cow Cold.  Before Cow Cold, the sale of milk in Osten State was $2.5 million each week; now it is less than $500,000.Odin State is the only area in the north without cases of Cow Cold.  Before we know how to deal with Cow Cold, we can only hope Odin State will be lucky enough not to experience the power of this killer cold.

However, in many parts of the world, water is not just about one’s everyday needs.  In countries like Tanzania, water is hard to get, and the job of collecting water falls on women’s shoulders.  Girls are often kept home from school to collect water while their brothers stay at school studying.  Studies show Tanzanian girls who live 15 minutes from clean water spend 12% more time at school than those who live an hour away.  More time spent collecting water means less time for learning.  For these girls, “Knowledge is power” is not just words; it is a sad fact in real life.  With less time spent at school, their chances of getting well-paid jobs are small, and they often have no voice in important matters, like who to marry.  These girls are often married into poor families.  They have little money or knowledge to take care of their children, who often end up dying young.  For the baby girls who are lucky enough to live, their life may still center around “water,” just like it did for their mothers.</td>

An American study in 2006 showed that people today    39   .  Over 99% of the people who were interviewed agree that a husband, a wife, and a child are a family.  At the same time, 94% see a parent with a child as a family, 91% say a husband and a wife, without children, are a family, and 81% think a man and a woman, with a child, but not married, are a family too.The study also found that    40    is very important in the modern thinking on family.  Though 81% think a man and a woman, not married, with a child, are a family, the percentage (%) drops to 40% if the couple doesn’t have a child.  This is also true with same-sex couples.  About 60% see two men, or two women, with a child, as a family, but only 32% think so when the couple doesn’t have a child.In the study, those who see two men or two women that live together as a family often\tfind\tit\tOK\tfor\tsame-sex\tcouples\tto\tget\tmarried.\t\t   41   .  However, not everyone opens their arms to same-sex couples: the study said 30% have no problem seeing pets as part of one’s family, but they do not think a same-sex couple is a family. couple 伴侶  same-sex 同性</td>

Shortly after Robert saw it, it was gone.Though Robert felt a little strange, he did not think about it too much and sat down for a rest on a bench in the park.  Then he noticed the snake he had just seen     17    .  Robert was too afraid to move away from the bench.  Right at this moment, a woman behind him shouted, “Come here, Robert.  You can’t stay on the bench like that.      18    .” In surprise, Robert turned around and said to the woman, “Excuse me, but that’s not a very nice thing to say, and in fact some people say I’m handsome.”“I’m not talking to you,” said the woman.  “I’m telling Robert, my pet snake, to get down from the bench, not you.”</td>
